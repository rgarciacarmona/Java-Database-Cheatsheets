Java Database Cheatsheets
=========================

This repository is a collection of several cheatsheets that I use to teach an undergrad course on databases using Java (JDBC, JPA, JAXB). They are written in GitHub flavored Markdown, so they can be easily edited. I also provide PDF and HTML versions of the sheets for the students.

The suggested study order is:

1. JDBC Cheatsheet
2. JPA Cheatsheet
3. JPA Inheritance
4. JAXB Cheatsheet
5. Date with Java-SQL-XML

The course also includes several examples of the technologies covered by the cheatsheets. Each demo has its own repository:

+ **JDBC Demo:** [https://github.com/rgarciacarmona/JDBC-Demo]
+ **JPA Demo:** [https://github.com/rgarciacarmona/JPA-Demo]
+ **JAXB Demo:** [https://github.com/rgarciacarmona/JAXB-Demo]

Each demo is built on top of the previous one.
